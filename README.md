# Nacelle
One of Nacelle font mirrors, provided by Reinhart Previano.

# About
This font is originally created by [Sora Sagano](http://dotcolon.net/) under the CC0 License. The font has 16 variants: 8 different weights with respective italic styles. While the [official font page](http://dotcolon.net/font/nacelle/) is in Japanese, other sites including [Font Library](https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/nacelle) and [Befonts](https://befonts.com/nacelle-font-family.html) provide download mirrors for this font.

This repository is intended to host the same font with different font formats, such as WOFF and SVG formats, for further use on the Web, which is allowed under the [SIL Open Font License (OFL), Version 1.1](https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL). A CSS file containing the `@font-face` properties is also hosted to fix font name confusion as in [Font Library CDN](https://fontlibrary.org/face/nacelle).

# Usage
All Nacelle fonts are stored under the fonts folder. However, a preconfigured CSS file is available at the root folder for quick reference.

## Version Differences
All Nacelle font CSS files are under the same directory: `https://reinhart1010.github.io/nacelle/`. However, there are some differences
+ [nacelle.css](https://reinhart1010.github.io/nacelle/nacelle.css) uses the full version of Nacelle fonts: OTF, TTF, SVG, EOT, WOFF and WOFF2. This is compatible with most browsers and browser versions, while the file may be large to be downloaded.
+ [nacelle.min.css](https://reinhart1010.github.io/nacelle/nacelle.min.css) is the minified version of [nacelle.css](https://reinhart1010.github.io/nacelle/nacelle.css).
+ [nacelle.lite.css](https://reinhart1010.github.io/nacelle/nacelle.lite.css) only uses the TTF, WOFF and WOFF2 formats, which is supported in more modern browsers.
+ [nacelle.lite.min.css](https://reinhart1010.github.io/nacelle/nacelle.lite.min.css) is the minified version of [nacelle.lite.css](https://reinhart1010.github.io/nacelle/nacelle.lite.css).
